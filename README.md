# Site of PremiumPark

Site of my village. I'll try to use Jekyll.  

Apr, 10: Map is ready. Price is ready too. Now we can start adv.

Apr, 2: I need to add all free areas of village to my json base,
I think... And I have an Idea: convert xlsx file to csv, then
install csvtojson (from npm) and make a command 
`csvtojson data.csv > output.csv --delimiter=';'`
and congratulations =)
