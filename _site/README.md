# Site of PremiumPark

Site of my village. I'll try to use Jekyll.  

Apr, 2: I need to add all free areas of village to my json base,
I think... And I have an Idea: convert xlsx file to csv, then
install csvtojson (from npm) and make a command 
`csvtojson data.csv > output.csv --delimiter=';'`
and congratulations =)


[ToDo:]  
- [ ] make all sections  
- [ ] make restricted zone with billing  
- [ ] ...
